# Instagram_Automation
Automate some aspect of your life using Python.
InstaPy is a popular Python library for automating interactions on Instagram. It provides a convenient way to perform actions such as liking, commenting, following, and unfollowing users, as well as scraping data from Instagram accounts.

Here's an example of how you can use InstaPy to automate following users based on specific criteria:

Step 1: Install InstaPy
-----------------------
Make sure you have InstaPy installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install instapy
```

Step 2: Import InstaPy and Set Up Configuration
----------------------------------------------
Create a new Python file and import the necessary modules:

```python
from instapy import InstaPy
from instapy import smart_run
```

Next, set up the configuration for your Instagram account:

```python
# Set up your account credentials
username = '<your_username>'
password = '<your_password>'

# Create an InstaPy session
session = InstaPy(username=username, password=password)
```

Step 3: Configure Automation Settings
------------------------------------
Configure the settings for automation. In this example, we'll automate following users who have specific keywords in their bio or posts:

```python
# Set up the automation settings
with smart_run(session):
    session.set_relationship_bounds(enabled=True, potency_ratio=1.5)
    session.set_do_follow(True, percentage=100)
    session.set_user_interact(amount=3, randomize=True, percentage=100, media='Photo')

    # Set up specific target accounts or keywords
    session.follow_by_tags(['python', 'programming'], amount=10, interact=True)
```

In this code snippet, we enable following, set the follow percentage to 100% (to follow all eligible users), and set interaction settings to like 3 random photos of each user.

The `follow_by_tags` method allows you to specify tags related to your interests. In this example, we're following 10 users who have posts or bios containing the tags 'python' or 'programming'.

Step 4: Run the Automation Script
--------------------------------
Save the changes and run the Python script. The automation will start and perform the actions you specified, such as following users who meet the criteria.

Remember to use automation tools responsibly and within the limits defined by the social media platform. Make sure to review and comply with the terms of service and community guidelines of the social media platform you're automating.

Please note that Instagram and other platforms may have restrictions on automation, and using automated tools may violate their terms of service. Use social media automation responsibly and consider the guidelines and limitations set by the platforms you interact with.
